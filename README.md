# responsiveWeb

First project from Jonas Schmedtmann's course 'Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS'

<p>
By building this project for a fictitious blog post in a magazine, I practiced building a webpage from scratch using HTML and CSS. I worked on:
<ul>
    <li>using semantic and non-semantic HTML elements </li>
    <li>creating text elements, including ordered and unordered list elements</li>
    <li>inserting hyperlinks, images and attributes </li>
    <li>styling text and hyperlinks</li>
    <li>applying classes, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements and selectors</li>
    <li>using margins and paddings, adding dimensions</li>
    <li>styling a button and applying absolute positioning</li>
    <li>using and clearing floats</li>
    <li>applying box-sizing</li>
    <li>using flexbox to align elements</li>
    <li>placing, aligning, and spanning items in columns and rows using CSS Grid</li>
</ul>
